Transformative Community Building Programs

Bahala Foundation programs provide community building opportunities through organizing multigenerational repair clinics, knowledge shares and skill building. The deeper intention is to reduce the isolation people have been feeling since the pandemic. With a focus on innovation, technology, and harnessing generational knowledge, activities will emphasize the importance of reusing everyday materials and objects to create sustainability.  Developing and nurturing life skills among the next generation will naturally create new abilities, self-confidence, and a healthier and stronger community. Toward this end, we will offer the following complementary programs:

One-Time and Multi-Series Workshops: Volunteer experts will facilitate workshops at no cost that will equip community members with the necessary techniques to repurpose home goods, gain skills and build relationships. Our curriculum is relevant, highly engaging, and delivered by trained volunteer experts. To effectively address need and ensure strong participation, we will target the City of Santa Monica, Facebook Buy Nothing groups, Next Door community pages, Ask, Borrow, Give groups, schools and libraries. We will schedule workshops on weekends at free facilities such as the public library or the farmer’s market to increase accessibility. parents’ busy schedules. Volunteer experts will utilize learner-centered approaches to facilitating workshops in: 

* Sewing and textile repair
* Household appliance repair
* Woodworking and furniture repair
* Bicycle repair and knowledge
* Technology skills and coding
* Gardening 
* Cooking and meal planning 
* Community building 

To support ongoing learning, Bahala Foundation will provide resources to workshop participants after each workshop on our website, so that guidance is just a fingertip away.

Online Forums: We will create an online community forum on our website to foster continued relationship building among participants.

Online forums leverage learning opportunities by providing information, collaboration, communication and connection. The online forums will also serve to be a vehicle to keep participants engaged in the program, and inform them of future workshops. 

Social media will also be connected to the foundation, and will be used to encourage the younger generation to post success stories to showcase their new skills.

The website will also support the curricula, offer activities, and provide a space for participants to connect in their free time. 

Alumni Program: As participants transition into an alumni status and/or gain mastery in an area, we will invite them to join the Alumni Program as ambassadors, mentors and co-facilitators:

* Ambassadors: Program alumni effectively articulate stories of impact – to other program participants, volunteers and donors – given their direct experience with the program.
* Mentors: Confidence levels of new program participants grow when mentored by program alumni who went through the program and can share their own stories of success.  
* Co-Facilitators: As we expand, we will train our seasoned alumni to become workshop co-facilitators. 

The foundation will coordinate annual gatherings of alumni to provide organizational updates, obtain feedback on their experiences with the Alumni Program, and share best practices and lessons learned to inform program improvement.
